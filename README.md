-  Hi, Iâ€™m @Emilio25232
-  Iâ€™m interested in Linux, Operating Systems, IA, Games, Cryptography, Cybersecurity and much more.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning many things, included programming with C, C++ and Java, automatization task with python, how kernel and OS work, and how to do my own.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on very small/small projects that require learning new things and need some investigation.
